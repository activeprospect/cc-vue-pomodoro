# FrontEnd Coding Challenge - Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple productivity and time management method to
help the practitioner focus and ignore distractions. The technique uses a timer
to break up work into 25 minute chunks of time (called a pomodoro), with a 5
minute break in between each work period (i.e. pomodoro). After 4 pomodoros, a
longer (20 minute) break occurs, at the end of which, the cycle begins anew.

**An example:**

- Pomodoro 1 (25 minutes) - perform some work
- Break 1 (5 minutes) -  do nothing associated with the work
- Pomodoro 2 (25 minutes) - perform some work
- Break 2 (5 minutes) -  do nothing associated with the work
- Pomodoro 3 (25 minutes) - perform some work
- Break 3 (5 minutes) -  do nothing associated with the work
- Pomodoro 4 (25 minutes) - perform some work
- Long Break (20 minutes) -  do nothing associated with the work

## Up and Running

Your challenge is to create a Pomodoro timer. To do that, fork this repo into
your personal GitHub account, and then clone it to your local environment.

### Installation

From within the project, run:

```
> npm install
```

### Developing

While working on the challenge, use run:

```
> npm run dev
```

Share your screen with your interviewer.

## Challenge

To complete the challenge, your project must...

- Allow the user to start and stop the timer.
- Display the time remaining in the pomodoro and the breaks
- Keep a count of the number of completed pomodoros

### Bonus Points

- Set the timer back to zero if it is in the middle of a pomodoro
- Set the timer to zero and move to the next pomodoro if it is stopped in a
  break
- Provide a way for the user to track interruptions, and provide a count of
  interruptions for each pomodoro

- Tests
