# VueJS Coding Challenge - Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple productivity and time management method to
help the practitioner focus and ignore distractions. The technique uses a timer
to break up work into 25 minute chunks of time (called a pomodoro), with a 5
minute break in between each work period (i.e. pomodoro). After 4 pomodoros, a
longer (20 minute) break occurs, at the end of which, the cycle begins anew.

**An example:**

- 1st Pomodoro (25 minutes)
- 1st Break (5 minutes)
- 2nd Pomodoro (25 minutes)
- 2nd Break (5 minutes)
- 3rd Pomodoro (25 minutes)
- 3rd Break (5 minutes)
- 4th Pomodoro (25 minutes)
- Long Break (20 minutes)

## Challenge

To complete the challenge, your project must...

- Allow the user to start and stop the timer.
- Display the time remaining in the pomodoro and the breaks
- Keep a count of the number of completed pomodoros

### Bonus Points

- Set the timer back to zero if it is in the middle of a pomodoro
- Set the timer to zero and move to the next pomodoro if it is stopped in a
  break
- Provide a way for the user to track interruptions, and provide a count of
  interruptions for each pomodoro
